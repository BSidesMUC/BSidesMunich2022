title: 'Not quite water under the bridge: Review of cross-chain bridge hacks'
track: 1
---

As the blockchain industry shifted towards a multi-chain world, bridges became an important part of the ecosystem.
Designs of bridges vary and could range from quite primitive to extremely complex.
Bridge hacks have led to a loss of over 1 billion USD worth of cryptocurrencies in the past year.
In this talk, we provide a breakdown of high level components and different processes of bridges and identify their risks.
We will then deep dive into past hacks that specifically targeted bridges.
