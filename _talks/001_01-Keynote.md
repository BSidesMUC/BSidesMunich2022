When starting a career in security, especially in the Cyber Defense field, you are overwhelmed with new topics, concepts and buzzwords.
Also sometimes you think, am I the only one with that problem?
Whom should I talk to? Is there a trusted group I can share my problems, my experience or even my failure?

Or in a nutshell: Is there anybody out there?

This talk will discuss my personal experience growing up in the Incident Response Community.
What I have learned, gained and experienced.
I hope that attendees will learn from my experience and especially from my mistakes I did over the past two decades.

Also communities are important for us, they still have the typical problems like scale of trust.
I will raise some of them and give you ideas, how we may be able to overcome them.
