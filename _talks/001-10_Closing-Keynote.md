Everyone wants to put tests into the release pipeline, but no one wants to wait hours for them to finish.  
In this talk we will discuss multiple options for adding dynamic application security testing (DAST) to your CI/CD, in ways that won’t compromise speed or results, such as limiting scope, using HAR files, using test subsets, etc.  
We will also cover several other options for automation of finding vulnerabilities in your web apps and APIs, all at the speed of DevOps.
