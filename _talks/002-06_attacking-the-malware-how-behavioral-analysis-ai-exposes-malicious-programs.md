title: 'Attacking the malware: How behavioral analysis & AI exposes malicious programs'
track: 2
---

Malware poses one of the greatest threats on the cyber-industry.
More than 450,000 new malicious programs, and potentially unwanted applications (PUA) are registered every day (AV-Test Institute, 2022).
As a result, there is an imperative need to automate the process of malware analysis by onboarding artificial intelligence into our defence toolbox.
In this talk, we are going to discuss some of the state-of-art methodologies that modern anti-viruses use for malware discovering and classification.
Furthermore, we are going to dive deep into Malhuer framework (Rieck et al., 2011).
We will examine how the behaviour of any software -benign or malicious- can be modelled, how modern sandbox finding reports can be transformed & embedded into a N-dimensional vector space, and how the extracted data-points can be compressed into a much smaller set of prototypes, with the goal of reducing the computational complexity of the machine learning algorithms and making them practical.
This embedding of the software's behaviour enables us to use well-known (or slight variants) of clustering & classification algorithms, in order to either classify unknown programs or discover novel clusters of malware.
At last we are going examine an algorithm of incremental analysis that allows the continuous re-train of the machine learning models and the optimisation of their precision, recall and F-measure.

The talk is based on this paper: http://www.mlsec.org/malheur/docs/malheur-jcs.pdf
