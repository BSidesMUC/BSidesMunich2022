This talk will provide an overview on how to introduce security into a typical cloud based product from the ground up.
Short-, medium- and long-term security activities will be discussed, with specific proposals what high impact topics should be addressed in the beginning.

The content of this talk will cover a broad range, from technical topics, s.a.
tooling for security automation or container security, all the way to non-technical topics such as compliance or risk assessment.
