While disassembling PCs that had Turbo buttons, Oliver discovered his passion for all things IT early on.
He began his professional career in a time when people still used the term IT security, and to this day enjoys the offensive and defensive sides of his profession, especially if it's technical or involves some hardware.
To cool off after a busy day, Oliver likes to take a dip in ice cold water, spend time with the family and play a game or two of multiplayer Tetris.
