Technological non-binary explorer, trying to understand everything around them - sometimes at the expense of (industrial or automotive) hardware and software integrity.
Loves good style from classic 20s to steam-, cyberpunk and gothic.
Did historical fencing and is playing violin (badly).
Also into OSINT, Star Trek and part of the AG KRITIS.
