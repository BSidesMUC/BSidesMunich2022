Silvio started his cybersecurity journey when IRC was still a thing but BBS boards weren’t anymore.
Since that time he was a student, a systems engineer, a consultant, a researcher and currently is an enthusiastic collector of red-teamers tears as part of an awesome blue team.
He likes to do non computer stuff as well - but that’s a story for a different day.
